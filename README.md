**WARNING** :<br> This repo branch ( migrating-to-jimja2 ) locally on server<br>
          share src directory (linked localy ) with 
          the repo named **"jinja2-first-fastapi"** <br> branch (migrate-from-php)
          [I'M NOT SURE THIS IS TO BE NOTICED AS "GOOD PRACTICES]<br>
          => Any help to circomvince this and share data space while
             at the same time <br> updating 2 projects without rewriting
             Is Welcome !!!<br>
Means locally src directory goes out there:  
https://github.com/rdanf1/jinja2-first-fastapi/blob/migrate-from-php/<templates>

ISSUES envolved : Few space on my testing server, don't like to re-write.


*REMINDER* : Ctrl-SHIFT-V paste previously copied buffer in VI !!! (insertion mode)
